Dear Ms. Tolwinski-Ward:

In my experience, code error correction in climate models is an expected 
part of the process and usually handled through updated releases 
(e.g. version 1.x) by the supporting organization. Similar procedures 
are followed in supporting data analysis and visualization software (GrADS) 
and other software products, both freely distributed and commercial.  
It seems that you have done this already. You point out that the equation 
with the error is not in the paper and that the changes are minor. 
You could mention the error in a future publication and provide a link 
to your evaluation of its effect. Therefore, I would think that 
an erratum is not necessary. 

However, if you feel that it is important to publish an erratum, 
I would have no objection.

Kind regards,
Edwin Schneider
